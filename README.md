## Simulation of Epidemic Spread in a Room

### Objective:
Simulate the spread of an epidemic within a room, taking into account the movements of individuals and their interactions.

### Features:
- **Room Initialization:** Random distribution of individuals within a room with a maximum capacity of 8 people per square.
- **Neighbor Detection:** Determination of adjacent squares to a given position.
- **Individual Movement:** Individuals have the ability to move to adjacent available squares.
- **Virus Spread:** Simulation of contamination based on proximity to infected individuals and a probability of contagion.
- **Spread Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the epidemic's progression within the room.

### Technologies Used:
- Python

### Functioning:
The user specifies the parameters of the simulation, then observes in real time the progression of the epidemic within the room, highlighting the impact of social interactions and movements on disease spread.

### Conclusion:
This simulation offers an interactive and visual way to understand the fundamental principles of epidemic modeling, highlighting the importance of movements and interactions in the spread of infectious diseases.
